//		"Countermeasure Effectiveness"	"0.9"		//a percentage (1 = 100%) which determines how likely the missile will lock onto a flare or chaff rather than the actual target when flares or chaff is inbetween it and its target. When a flare or chaff is detected in front of the missile, a number between 0.000 and 1.000 is generated.  If the number is less than the effectiveness number, the missile will target the flare/chaff.
//		"Turning Ability"		"0.2"		//determines how effective the missile can turn to home in on its target or guide itself to the crosshair for a guided missile; 1.0 means the missile can turn instantly towards its target, 0.0 and the missile doesn't turn at all
