Code Guide
==================

In order to help maintain consistency and conform to the standards setout in the [codingstandards]
document, it is recommended that you install the editorconfig plugin for your favourite text editor.
If your unsure of what this plugin is, here is a quote from their website:

```
EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. 
The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor 
plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
```

The only thing required is that you install the plugin into your favourite text editor and it should load the
settings from the [.editorconfig] file in the repository and apply those settings for files only within the 
repository.
