During some testing, I have discovered that while the vpk technique will definitely
work, certain files will need to remain external to make the game functional.
the presets for vehicle configuration, only seem to work outside since write access
to the files internally to the vpk isn't possible.

Currently, with them internal, any configuration you do to a vehicle at time of building
it defaults back to the configuration saved into the preset. This should be only a minor
issue as we can just keep those files out in the custom folder in folder/file format.

On further testing, also found that in addition to seperating out the presets, the gameinfo
line that searches for the custom folder needs write capability to that area to actually 
save the preset. ie: game+mod+mod_write
